site: material.angular.io
     
1. ng add @angular/material

 to add button first import and add to app.module.ts
 then use it in html the code you took from the site
 then nodemodules--angular--material--prebuilt themes--your theme

2. create components
    header,footer,sidebar,mainContent
3. then set the selectors in app.comp.html
4. then first add sidenav
 select the api for sidebar from site and import them
 then in app component paste the html code from the website
 then inside mat drawer paste the sidebar selectors and inside 
 mat drawer content paste the main content selector

 5. then whenever you want anything to design you should import its api in module.ts and then use it whereever you need

6. then if you want to edit something in css if its possible to edit certain material it will be given inside the site, copy and paste them

7. to add more icons to material fontawesomeicons.com where you can get the icon code and paste that name to your code.

8. first set the side-bar in your style by editing on its html and css

9. set the main content in this project you will need to add 4 components for main-content:
    card,area-chart,pie-chart,table

10. after creating the components set the position of each component by setting the selectors in the desired position
    
11. then you can design each of those components

12. if you want a particular component inisde something go to main-content.html and give the selector inside the desired component

13. if you have a parent design for 2 or more components and you want different design in each of them.
    we have to do parent to child communication

14. that means we have to go to the  ts file of parent n child and using the input selector we can set the variable 
    which we can use in the main-contents  selectors after string interpolating child in their respective html files.
    parent to child - @input
    @Input heading:string="" like this in ts file 
    <h1>{{heading}}</h1> in html file
    <app heading="angular"></app> in mainContent html file


15. child to parent communication
1 Parent - child components communication
    --------------------------------------
    1 Child to Parent - @Output decorator

    Parent -header component(toggle)
    Child - side-bar component (app.component)

    => EventEmitter -Used to generate userdefined events
                -Its a class
                -emit() is a method of EventEmitter class

        i)header.html button (click)="menuIconClick()"
        ii)header.ts- Userdefined event - @Output() toggle=new EventEmitter();
        iii)app.html- <app-header (toggle)="sidebarToggle()">
        iV)app.ts- sidebar:boolean=true
        v)app.html- <mat-drawer mode="side" [opened]="sidebar">

    2 Parent to Child component communication
     
     @Input() decorator

Attribute Directives
   Based on a class property we can apply style to the html element

   1)Inbuild Attribute Directives : [ngClass]
   2)Userdefined Attribute Directives


Install highcharts in angular npm i highcharts-angular --save
then in npm highcharts
1 import module
2 import html code
3 import component code and edit as given below
    Highcharts = Highcharts;
    chartOptions={}

    constructor(){
      this.chartOptions = {give the code of the chart you wish to use discluding the discluding the container}
    }
